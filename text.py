NEWSPAPER_ARTICLE = """Marilyn Monroe (June 1, 1926 â€“ August 4, 1962) was an American actress and model. Known for playing comic 'blonde bombshell' characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s. Marilyn contracted with the William Morris Agency in August 1945. The agency deemed Monroe's figure more suitable for pin-up than high fashion modeling at the time. One year later Marilyn signed a contract with 20th Century-Fox learning acting, singing, and dancing. Her contract was renewed in February 1947. On the evening of August 4, 1962, the American actress Marilyn Monroe died at age 36 of a 'barbiturate overdose' between 8:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. inside her home.
